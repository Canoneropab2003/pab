			<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
			<p>
		As a computer engineering student, there are several principles that I should strive to embody in order to maximize my learning and development. These include curiosity, perseverance, attention to detail, collaboration, and ethics. By embodying these principles and others like them, I can become a skilled and responsible computer engineering student who is well-equipped to make meaningful contributions to the field.
	</p>
			<p> 
		Curiosity: As a computer engineering student, it's important to maintain a sense of curiosity and wonder about the field. Ask questions, explore new ideas, and seek out opportunities to learn and grow. Cultivating a sense of intellectual curiosity will help you stay engaged and motivated, even when faced with difficult challenges. 
	</p>
			<p>
	Perseverance: Computer engineering can be a challenging field, and it's important to be resilient in the face of setbacks and failures. Develop a strong work ethic and a willingness to keep pushing forward, even when things get tough. Remember that every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow.
	</p>
			<p>
	Attention to detail: Computer engineering requires a high degree of precision and attention to detail. Whether you're designing hardware or writing software, small mistakes can have big consequences. Develop good habits around testing, debugging, and documentation, and always strive for accuracy and precision in your work.
